Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to implement the MD5 algorithm:

1. Preprocessing
1.1 Convert Input to Binary
Convert the input string into its binary representation.
1.2 Padding
Append a 1 bit to the binary message.
Append 0 bits until the length of the message is congruent to 448 mod 512.
Append the original message length (in bits) as a 64-bit little-endian integer.

2. Initialize MD5 Constants
Initialize four 32-bit words (A, B, C, D) with the following constants:
A = 0x67452301
B = 0xefcdab89
C = 0x98badcfe
D = 0x10325476

3. Define Auxiliary Functions
Define the following bitwise functions:
F(X, Y, Z) = (X & Y) | (~X & Z)
G(X, Y, Z) = (X & Z) | (Y & ~Z)
H(X, Y, Z) = X ^ Y ^ Z
I(X, Y, Z) = Y ^ (X | ~Z)
Also, define a left rotation function:
rotate_left(x, n) = (x << n) | (x >> (32 - n))

4. Process the Message in 512-bit Blocks
Divide the padded message into 512-bit blocks.
For each block:
Break it into 16 words of 32 bits each.
Perform 64 rounds of operations using the auxiliary functions, predefined constants, and the message words.

5. Update Hash Values
After processing each block, update the values of A, B, C, and D.

6. Produce the Final Hash
Concatenate the final values of A, B, C, and D (in little-endian format) to produce the 128-bit hash.
